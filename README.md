# Phyllotaxis: Draw Flowers Using Mathematics
## Description
R is a tool for doing serious statistics and data analysis. But not everything in life can be serious, life is also beautiful, and R can make beautiful things too. R can make art.

The arrangement of leaves on a plant stem is ruled by spirals. This fact is called [phyllotaxis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phyllotaxis) and it is a nice example of how mathematics can describe patterns in nature. In this project, we will invent flowers using this fact.
