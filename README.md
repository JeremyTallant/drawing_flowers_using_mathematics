# Phyllotaxis: Draw Flowers Using Mathematics
## Description
R is a tool for doing serious statistics and data analysis. But not everything in life can be serious, life is also beautiful, and R can make beautiful things too. R can make art.

The arrangement of leaves on a plant stem is ruled by spirals. This fact is called [phyllotaxis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phyllotaxis) and it is a nice example of how mathematics can describe patterns in nature. In this project, we will invent flowers using this fact.
## Usage
## Usage
Clone this repository and open the Jupyter notebook file (`*.ipynb`) in a Jupyter environment with R kernel support. Make sure to install the required packages such as `tidyverse`. You can do this by running the following commands in a code cell within the notebook:
``` r
install.packages("tidyverse")
```
Once the packages are installed, run the code cells in the notebook to generate the plots and analyses.

If you don't have a Jupyter environment set up, you can install Jupyter Notebook and the R kernel using the following steps:

1. Install Jupyter Notebook by following the instructions on the [official Jupyter website](https://jupyter.org/install).

2. Install the R kernel for Jupyter Notebook by running the following commands in your R console:
``` r 
install.packages("IRkernel")
IRkernel::installspec()
```
After completing the installation, launch Jupyter Notebook, navigate to the folder containing the notebook file, and open it to begin running the analyses.
